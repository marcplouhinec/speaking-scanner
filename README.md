# Speaking Scanner

The goal of this application is to allow visually impaired people to read paper documents by using
a portable scanner and their smartphone.

This application has been developed in two versions:
* [With an Android device, a portable scanner and a USB OTG cable.](android/README.md)
* [With an iOS device, a portable scanner, a WiFi-to-BLE bridge and a web-service.](ios/README.md)

The Android version is much simpler and faster than the iOS one, because it uses a wire connection between the
smartphone and the scanner.

Here is a demo video in English of the Android version:
